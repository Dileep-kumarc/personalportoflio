✅ AGGRESSIVE MOBILE FIX APPLIED - Projects Section
=================================================

PROBLEM: Projects section causing horizontal scroll/stuck layout on mobile devices

SOLUTION APPLIED: Triple-layer fix approach

1. ✅ Inline Critical CSS in index.html (lines 49-82)
   - Forces mobile layout IMMEDIATELY on page load
   - Uses !important flags to override everything
   - Converts grid to block layout on mobile

2. ✅ Updated styles.css - Projects Section (lines ~1203-1545)
   - Forced display: block on mobile
   - Added aggressive overflow-x: hidden
   - Set all widths to 100% with box-sizing: border-box

3. ✅ Responsive Breakpoints:
   - Desktop (>1024px): 3-column grid
   - Tablet (768-1024px): 2-column grid  
   - Mobile (<768px): SINGLE COLUMN (forced with display: block)
   - Small mobile (<576px): Optimized padding
   - Extra small (<390px): Compressed layout

KEY CHANGES MADE:

✅ index.html - Line 5: Enhanced viewport meta tag
✅ index.html - Lines 49-82: Critical inline mobile CSS
✅ styles.css - Projects section completely rebuilt for mobile
✅ Used display: block instead of grid on mobile
✅ All widths set to 100% with !important flags
✅ Added overflow-x: hidden at multiple levels

TESTING:

1. Open your deployed site on mobile phone
2. Navigate to Projects section
3. Try to scroll horizontally - should be IMPOSSIBLE now
4. All project cards should stack vertically
5. No content should overflow viewport

DEPLOYMENT:

For Netlify:
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "Fix mobile projects section - force single column"
3. git push
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

For manual hosting:
1. Upload index.html
2. Upload styles.css
3. Clear browser cache
4. Test on mobile device

WHY THIS WILL WORK:

- Using display: block completely removes grid behavior on mobile
- Inline CSS loads FIRST, before external stylesheet
- !important flags override any conflicting styles
- Triple-layer approach ensures fix works even if one layer fails
- 100% widths prevent any possibility of overflow

STATUS: ✅ READY TO DEPLOY

If this still doesn't work, the issue is likely:
- Browser cache (clear it completely)
- Old version still cached on server
- Need to hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
